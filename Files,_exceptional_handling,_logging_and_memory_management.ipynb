        "Que. 1) What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ?\n",
        ":-> Compiled language Entire program translated into machine code once, before execution. And Interpreted Language Translated line by line during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 2) What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
        ":-> Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to manage and respond to runtime errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 3) What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
        ":-> The primary purpose of the finally block in exception handling (like in Python, Java, C#, etc.) is to specify a block of code that must be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 4) What is logging in Python ?\n",
        ":-> Logging in Python is a mechanism that allows developers to record events that happen while their software is running.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 5) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        ":-> The significance of the __del__ method in Python lies in its role as an object finalizer or \"destructor\", which is intended to perform necessary cleanup actions immediately before an object is destroyed and its memory is reclaimed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 6) What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        ":-> The difference between import and from ... import in Python lies in how they make names (like functions, classes, and variables) accessible within your current module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 7) How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python ?\n",
        ":-> You can handle multiple exceptions in Python in several ways, using different structures within the try...except block. The two primary methods are using multiple except blocks and using a single except block with a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 8) What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python ?\n",
        ":-> The purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python is to ensure that a resource, specifically a file, is properly closed and cleaned up immediately after its use, even if errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 9) What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing ?\n",
        ":-> The difference between multithreading and multiprocessing lies in how they achieve parallelism and how they relate to the underlying operating system (OS) processes.Both techniques aim to execute multiple operations concurrently, but they do so using different units of execution and memory models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 10) What are the advantages of using logging in a program ?\n",
        ":-> The advantages of using logging in a program, especially when compared to simple print statements, are numerous and primarily center around control, context, and permanence. Logging transforms simple output into a structured, manageable data stream essential for robust applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 11) What is memory management in Python ?\n",
        ":-> Memory management in Python is the process of allocating and deallocating memory resources to objects and data structures during the execution of a program. Unlike languages like C or C++, Python handles this process automatically through its own mechanisms .\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 12) What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python ?\n",
        ":-> The basic steps involved in exception handling in Python revolve around the try, except, else, and finally keywords, which define blocks of code to manage potential errors and ensure cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 13) Why is memory management important in Python ?\n",
        ":-> Memory management is important in Python because it allows the language to be a high-level, easy-to-use tool while still efficiently and safely handling system resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 14) What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n",
        ":-> The fundamental role of try and except in exception handling is to create a structure that allows a program to test for errors and gracefully recover from them without crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 15) How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n",
        ":-> Python's garbage collection system works through a combination of two primary mechanisms: Reference Counting and a Generational Garbage Collector (also known as the cycle collector).This dual-system approach balances speed and completeness to automatically manage the memory heap and ensure that objects that are no longer in use are destroyed and their memory is reclaimed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 16) What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        ":-> The purpose of the else block in Python exception handling is to define a section of code that must execute only if the code in the try block completed successfully, without raising any exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 17) What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n",
        ":-> The common logging levels in Python, from least severe to most severe, are: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. They are defined in the logging module and are used to categorize log messages based on their severity or importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 18) What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python ?\n",
        ":-> The core difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python is that os.fork() is a low-level, OS-specific system call for creating a new process, whereas the multiprocessing module is a high-level, cross-platform abstraction built to manage processes safely and easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 19) What is the importance of closing a file in Python ?\n",
        ":-> The importance of closing a file in Python is critical for resource management, data integrity, and system stability. It ensures that all data is correctly written to the storage device and that system resources are properly released.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 20) What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python ?\n",
        ":-> file.read() Reads the entire file into a single string by default, or reads the specified number of bytes/characters if a size argument is provided.\n",
        "And file.readline() Reads only a single line from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 21) What is the logging module in Python used for ?\n",
        ":-> The logging module in Python is a built-in, powerful, and flexible facility used for recording events that happen while a program is running. It is the standard, best-practice replacement for simple print statements, providing a structured and configurable way to manage program output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 22) What is the os module in Python used for in file handling ?\n",
        ":-> The os module in Python is used in file handling to interact with the operating system (OS).\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 23) What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n",
        ":-> Memory management in Python is automatic and generally works well, but it faces several challenges, primarily stemming from the interplay between its two mechanisms—Reference Counting and the Generational Garbage Collector—and external factors like the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 24) How do you raise an exception manually in Python ?\n",
        ":-> You raise an exception manually in Python using the raise statement. This is typically done when a condition in your code is met that you deem exceptional and want to stop execution or trigger an error handler (except block).\n",
        "\n",
        "Que. 25) Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        ":-> It's important to use multithreading in certain applications primarily to improve responsiveness and efficiency by allowing a program to handle multiple tasks concurrently within a single process."
